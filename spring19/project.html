    <h2>Reports and Code</h2>

    <p> <b>Submission:</b> Submit your reports and code to me via email.</p>

    <p> <b>Proposal:</b> Your project proposal should describe what you plan to
      do, why it is interesting, how you plan to do it, and what you are not
      sure about. Also describe what resources you think you will need to carry
      out the project (e.g., VMs, datasets).
      The end product of the proposal is a crisp <b>problem statement</b>
      and a <b>feasibility study</b> based on concrete examples and datasets.
      The proposal contributes to 1% of your final score.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint reports:</b> Please see the Deadline section for what you
      should include in your checkpoint reports.
      The checkpoint reports do not need to be formal (you can use Google
        docs). However, checkpoint reports do contribute to 4% of your final score
        (2% each).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Final paper:</b> Your final paper should be written like a research
      paper you read in class.
      The report should be no longer than 6 pages.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Code:</b> You can host your code at GitHub or BitBucket, and send me
      the link.
      It is ok if you want to keep your code confidential,
      but please talk to me explicitly.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Paper/report format:</b> Please format you reports and papers with the
      <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates">new
        USENIX paper template</a> (2019 conferences).
    </p>

    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>

    <p>
      The projects could be (but not limited to) one of the following forms:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conduct an empirical study of a special type of reliability issues
          that occurred in real-world system deployments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build a tool or a method that systematically uncovers reliability
          issues of existing software or system configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Measure certain reliability aspects of a special type of software or system configurations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking (on
    <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jqmpxf81ut658u" target="_blank">Piazza</a>).
    But I highly
    encourage you to pursue your own ideas.
