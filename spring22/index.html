    <h2>Course Overview</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this course is to teach the principles and practices of
        reliability engineering in modern "cloud-scale" systems, and expose
        students to the research of software and system reliability.
        We will look at how large-scale systems fail in the
        real world, and we will study the state-of-the-art reliability
        techniques and practices, including those widely adopted in industry
        and new ideas proposed by academia.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be going over the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Availability</li>
            <li>Hardware faults</li>
            <li>Software defects</li>
            <li>Misconfigurations</li>
            <li>Operation mistakes</li>
            <li>Network disruptions</li>
            <li>Bug detection</li>
            <li>Software testing</li>
            <li>Failure testing and chaos engineering</li>
            <li>Load tests and drain tests</li>
            <li>Monitoring</li>
            <li>Recovery</li>
            <li>Tracing</li>
            <li>Diagnosis</li>
          <!--
            <li>Auditing</li>
            <li>Formal verification</li>
            <li>Client-side reliability</li>
          -->
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a research-oriented seminar course with a major course project.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Prerequisite:</b> CS 423, ECE 391, CS 425, CS 433, CS 523, or CS 525 (or equivalent).
    </p>

    <h2>Reading List</h2>

    <p> The course does not have a textbook. Instead, the course material will
      come from seminal, noteworthy, or representative papers and articles from
      the literature. Each lecture (except the first) will have two assigned
      papers to read, typically including one from academia and the other
      from industry.
      You should read these papers <i>before</i> coming to class,
      and be prepared to discuss them. Occasionally I will also list
      recommended readings; you are encouraged to read those, but not required.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="readings.html" target="_blank">Reading list and schedule</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I highly recommend you to read <a class="paperlink" href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html" target="_blank">Griswold's
      advices on how to read a research paper</a>.
      The take-home message is that until you can answer a bunch of questions,
      you are not done reading a paper.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also strongly encourage you to discuss the papers with other students in
        the class — you may have insights that others do not, and vice versa.
        Often students form reading groups, which I heartily encourage.
        Note that group discussion, however, is not an effective substitute
        for actually reading the paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are required to write reviews for the assigned papers.
      The review form (which consists of a number of questions) will be posted at
      <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kyd945rv1gt2t" target="_blank">Piazza</a>.
      The review is due <b>11:59pm Mon/Wed</b> (the day before the class day).
      The paper reviews contribute to 10% of your overall grade.
    </p>

    <h2>Class Participation</h2>

    <p>
        Since this is a discuss-based course, class participation is required.
        We will discuss the papers and articles that we will have all read
        before each class. I will lead discussions by asking questions of
        students at random in class. Note that your answers to these questions
        form 10% of your overall grade,
        so it is important that you both show up to class as well as read the papers.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> What problem does the paper address?</li>
        <li> How is it different from previous work, if any?</li>
        <li> What is the approach used to solve the problem?</li>
        <li> How does the paper support or otherwise justify its arguments and conclusions?</li>
        <li> Was the paper, in your judgement, successful in addressing the problem?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Project</h2>

    <p>
        The best way to learn is by doing. You will undertake <i>your own</i> research
        project <b>individually</b> or <b>in a group of two</b>.
        A group with a size larger than two is not encouraged, but is possible if
          you have a strong justification that the project needs more members.
        I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking,
          but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas
          which typically lead to better results.
        You will write a project report and present it at the end of the course.
        The details of the research project is described in the following link.
    </p>

            <a href="project.html" target="_blank">Project Schedule and Instructions</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
       You can find <a href="https://cs523-uiuc.github.io/pub.html" target="_blank">a list of other projects that were
       subsequently published in workshops, conferences, and journals</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not release
      information that are not opened to public to protect students' work
      (many of which are closely connected to their thesis research).
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: You are expected to be aware of
        <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html" target="_blank">Academic
          Integrity Guidelines</a> of the University of Illinois.
          Any violation of the course or university policies
          will be treated seriously, and could lead to severe repercussions.
          Pleae don't cheat. It's not worth it.
    </p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>
        There is no homework, no midterm, no final exams.
        The course is about discussing Systems research (10%) and doing Systems research (90%).
        Note that the Project Proposal, Checkpoint Report 1, and Checkpoint Report 2 account for 5%, 5%, and 5%, respectively.
        <ul>
            <li>10%: Class Discussion</li>
            <li>10%: Homework</li>
            <li>10%: Assignment 1 (<font color="red">due Feb. 12</font>)</li>
            <li>10%: Assignment 2 (due TBD)</li>
            <li>2%:  Project Proposal</li>
            <li>3%:  Checkpoint Report 1</li>
            <li>5%:  Checkpoint Report 2</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
