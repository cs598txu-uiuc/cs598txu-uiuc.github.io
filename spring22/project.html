    <h2>Reports and Code</h2>

    <p> <b>Proposal:</b> Your project proposal should describe what you plan to
      do, why it is interesting, how you plan to do it, and what you are not
      sure about. Also describe what resources you think you will need to carry
      out the project (e.g., VMs, datasets).
      The end product of the proposal is a crisp <b>problem statement</b>.
      Please submit your report via a shared Google Doc (so we can comment on specific lines).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint #1:</b> Your checkpoint report should describe your progress
      on achieving the goals you included in your proposal.
      Clearly explain any changes you have made to the goal of your project
      based on your experience so far.
      Also, provide a concrete plan of what you will need to accomplish in the
      remaining weeks to complete your project.
      Please submit your report via a shared Google Doc (so we can comment on specific lines).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint #2:</b> Similar as Checkpoint #1.
      And what's more,
      you must include primary results (e.g., small-scale measurement results,
      examples that your prototype can already handle, etc).
      Please submit your report via a shared Google Doc (so we can comment on specific lines).
    </p>

    <p> <b>Final paper:</b> Your final paper should be written like a research
      paper you read in class. Your paper must be no longer than 6 pages.
      The paper can include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices.
      Please format your report using
      <a href="https://github.com/cs523-uiuc/final_report_template">this template</a>.
      Submissions formatted with other templates are invalid.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Code/data:</b> Please send us a copy of your code so we can check and skim.
      The simplest way is to host your project repository
      at GitHub or BitBucket. If you want to keep private repositories,
      add the instructor and TAs as the collaboators of your repositories.
      The GitHub IDs of the instructor and TAs will be announced on Piazza.
      It is ok if you want to keep your code confidential,
      but please talk to us explicitly.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Final presentation:</b> Please prepare a <font color="red">10-minute</font> presentation and record your presentation (do not exceed 10 minutes -- we will have penalty).

        {% comment %} how to make the video using zoom and send the instructor and TAs the video link. {% endcomment %}
    </p>

    <p> <b>Submission:</b> Submit your paper, code, and video in the following ways:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Paper:</b> Submit the PDF to the course email address.</li>
            <li><b>Code/data:</b> Put the link of your repository in the final paper.</li>
            <li><b>Video:</b> Put the link of your video in the final paper.</li>
       </ul>
       Please see <a href="https://github.com/cs523-uiuc/final_report_template/blob/main/metadata.tex">metadata.tex</a> of the paper template.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
    <p>
      I will provide a list of ideas to get you started thinking,
      but I highly encourage you to pursue your own ideas
      which typically lead to better results.
    </p>

    <p>
       You can find <a href="../pub.html" target="_blank">a list of 523 projects that were
       subsequently published in workshops, conferences, and journals</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not release
      information that are not opened to public to protect students' work
      (many of which are closely connected to their thesis research).
